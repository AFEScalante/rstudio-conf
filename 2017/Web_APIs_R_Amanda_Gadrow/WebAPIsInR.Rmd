[avoid um, yeah; slow down; levity?]
Good afternoon. My name is Amanda, and I am a software engineer at RStudio, focusing on customer support and product quality as it relates to the customer experience. As such, one of my biggest goals is to mine our support ticket data to learn what the trends in support tickets are, what features people are filing issues against, and how painful the problems are when they do occur. We use the answers to these questions to drive product improvements and documentation enhancements, to make our products better and our customers happier.

Unfortunately, this data isn't readily available in our support ticket tracking tool, which focuses on agent metrics rather than ticket content, but this tool does have a nice web API that I have used to pull the data into R.  Once there, I can slice and dice it however I like, find the answers to my questions, and get the resulting feedback to the rest of engineering. I was able to do so quickly and easily using a particular set of tools and techniques, and that is what I would like to share with you today.

## Assumptions

- A general interest in data, its acquisition, and its visualization

- Familiarity with R

- A basic understanding of HTTP communication concepts, if not the syntax

<div class="notes">
First, I've only got 20 minutes, so in order to get to the examples quicker, I'm going to make some assumptions about the level of API experience in the room.  However, at the end, I'll provide some links to resources that introduce some of these topics if you're not familiar with them.

So, I am assuming that you..

.

Request:

    curl "http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=clue&r=json"

Response:

    {"Title":"Clue","Year":"1985","Rated":"PG", ...}

```

<div class="notes">
This is a grossly oversimplified view of the interaction...
This is basically a conversation between two entities: a client and a server
Client can be an interactive interface like a browser, or another program like an API
For the latter, here is an example of a client request made with curl, a commonly installed Unix program, and a response from the server.
curl uses the GET method by default, so here we do not need to specify a verb
I'll talk a little bit more about JSON in a minute.
</div>

## What is an API | ... and why would I want to use one?

- API: Application Programming Interface

- APIs allow you to access a program from within another program

- For data retrieval, we usually mean APIs based on HTTP communication, a.k.a. web APIs

- APIs usually provide read and/or write access to data stores

- APIs allow you to access data on an ongoing basis

<div class="notes">
- I am also making an assumption that you know a bit about APIs, so I'm not going to go into this too deeply, but a quick review is useful.
- In this context, we are mostly concerned with data retrieval, so while APIs can be used to write data, we'll be focusing on reading it.
- APIs allow access to data without human intervention. Instead of interacting with the server via a browser, interacting via a script.
- Powerful because APIs facilitate automatic data retrieval
- APIs are great for accessing datasets that get updated regularly; get the most current information with each call
</div>

## Tools for accessing web APIs from R

- packages that wrap API calls for a given service
    - aws.s3, RGoogleAnalytics, acs, etc.

- **httr** for making requests

- **jsonlite, xml2** for parsing the response


*And once you have the data...*

- **dplyr, tidyr, lubridate**, etc. for data wrangling

<div class="notes">
- acs has methods that wrap the US Census API
- httr:  Useful tools for working with HTTP, organised by HTTP verbs (GET(), POST(), PUT(), etc). Configuration functions that make it easy to control additional request components (authenticate(), add_headers() and so on).
- jsonlite: A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the web. JavaScript Object Notation
- xml2: Parse XML-formatted responses. Extensible Markup Language

- JSON and XML are the most common response formats, and both represent data in key-value pairs.
- dplyr, tidyr, lubridate: tools for dealing with the data in the API response. The quality of the response, as well as the format and structure of the data, will vary from API to API, and your code will have to handle that appropriately.
- the goal is to parse the response and return a useful object, for analysis and visualization of that data

I find that this is easiest to understand in action...
</div>

## Lots of examples

**Example scripts are available in a repo I'll share at the end**

.

OMDB - http://www.omdbapi.com/

SWAPI - https://swapi.co/

Twitter (OAuth1) - https://api.twitter.com

GitHub (OAuth2) - https://api.github.com

<div class="notes">
I've prepared several examples, but in the interest of time, we will focus on SWAPI.
Importance of doc to understand signature/format, e.g., https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline
What should request look like, what will response format and content be
</div>

## Practical application {.smaller}

*Support Ticket Reports, in Two Parts*

1. R script to get support ticket data via API
    - Pages through data and puts it all in a single dataframe
    - Filters, tidies, and flattens the raw data into a nice, easy-to-use rectangle
    - Saves the tidied data to an S3 bucket
    - Deployed to RStudio Connect; scheduled to poll the API and update the datastore automatically
2. Various applications and Rmd documents pull the data from S3
    - Visualizations for tickets by product, OS, priority, category/feature, etc.
    - We use this data to target product improvements, documentation enhancements, process improvements

[Support Ticket Demo](SupportTickets.html)

<div class="notes">
This is all well and good if you desperately want data on Star Wars planets, but how can we use this pattern in the real world?

- 2. Apps and reports have no need to call the API themselves; can be loaded faster simply by pulling the RDS file from S3. No need to handle API errors; latest data available is always in S3
- Solve real-world problems with data from APIs
- Real power is in combination with other scripts and features. 
- Scheduled script could pipe the data to a DB or any other data store of your choice; we just happen to use S3 at the moment.
- Our apps and reports get updated automatically, with no user intervention
- Surprised by the plot for tickets filed by hour. We had been assuming that most people file tickets in the morning, but there are clearly more being filed in the late afternoon into the evening.
</div>

## Recap

- APIs are very useful sources of data, especially for datasets that are updated regularly.

- It's easy to pull API data into R -- and keep it up-to-date -- with the right packages and tools.

- Once you have the data in R, you can do all sorts of wonderful things with it.

> - Our next new support hire should probably be on the West Coast.
