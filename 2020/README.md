# rstudio-conf 2020
This is where we will store all of the materials and links for rstudio::conf 2020!

### About the Conference
rstudio::conf is all things R and RStudio! Over 2,200 advanced and new R users joined us in San Francisco, California to become better at data science with R - and have some fun along the way!
